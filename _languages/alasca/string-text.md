#### String

Bare-bone representation of bytes + length, enforces UTF-8.

```scala
"hey!"
```

 - multiline-strings:

```scala
let string: String = """Dear Sir or Madam, 
	it's a pleasure to converse with you, 
	because ..."""
```

 - equivalent to `"Dear Sir or Madam,\nit's a pleasure to converse with you,\nbecause ..."`
 - the right amount of whitespace can be stripped out, because the amount of indentation is well-defined in the language syntax â€“ no 'preceding whitespace'-problem

#### Text

Unicode-aware higher-level representation, includes locale/language information to implement things like lower-/upper-casing, "real" length correctly.

```scala
Text.en("hello") // english text
Text.de("Hallo") // german text
```
